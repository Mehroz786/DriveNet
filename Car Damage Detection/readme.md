 ## Car Scratch and Dent Detection using YOLOv8 🚗🔍

This repository contains the code for car scratch and dent detection using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. With this project, you can detect and localize scratches and dents on cars from images or videos.

### Explanation of the Model❗
For our project, we have decided to use object detection to gather the condition details of the car. Then after gathering the data like how many scratches or how many dents are on the car, we will give marks to car or something like that from '10' like 9 out of 10.
This condition will be used to predict the car price.
